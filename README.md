#Hello! My name is Jarett Dewbury 

I am a **Biomedical Engineering** undergraduate at the University of Waterloo. 
I am looking to explore a variety of topics ranging from brain-machine interfaces, deep learning, machine learning, 
artificial intelligence, neural engineering, software engineering, and research exploring the intersection of these fields! 


üß† I am currently researching and developing SSVEP-based brain computer interface models!


üèí Outside of academia, my passions focus around ice hockey, bike rides, and all things food
