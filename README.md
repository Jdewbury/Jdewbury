I am Jarett Dewbury, a machine learning researcher at Harvard Medical School and Massachusetts General Hospital working on semi and fully automated image processing applications for cancer segmentation and diagnosis. I am also a second-year undergraduate studying biomedical engineering at the University of Waterloo.


I am interested in the intersection of medicine and machine learning. My current research interests include the development of transformative and novel AI-enabled tools to aid clinicians in disease diagnosis and understanding.
