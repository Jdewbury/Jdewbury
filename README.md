🧬 I am a **Biomedical Engineering** undergraduate at the University of Waterloo. I am currently exploring a variety of topics ranging from brain-machine interfaces, deep learning, machine learning, artificial intelligence, neural engineering, signal processing, software engineering, and research exploring the intersection of these fields with medical applications! 

🧠 Outside of academia, my passions focus around ice hockey, bike rides, and all things food.
